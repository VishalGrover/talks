## First-steps

Change the firebase db connection in `FirebaseConnection.js` (go to [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) to create one if you don't have one (if not you will be using the prod db! (improving this is a ToDo...))

```
npm install
npm run watch
```

See `package.json` "scripts" or `gulpfile.babel.js` for more.
